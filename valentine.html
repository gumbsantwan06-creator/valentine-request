I want to create a PRD for a simple website to ask my girl to be my valentine. although there will be a no button, I want it to be dramatically unclickable like maybe it keeps disappearing or jumping to another location any time it is hovered on. there should be a gif when I am asking that basically has a beggy eye, maybe with a puppy with puppy eyes and when she clicks yes, the gif should change to a celebratory gif

This is a classic "digital grand gesture," and honestly, it’s a fun way to use a little bit of code to be a total romantic. The "evasive No button" is a developer rite of passage!

Here is a PRD (Product Requirements Document) to help you build this "Be My Valentine" experience.

Product Requirements Document: "The Valentine Vow"
1. Project Overview
A single-page, interactive web application designed to ask a partner to be a Valentine. The primary goal is to ensure a "Yes" through playful UI manipulation and charming visuals.

2. User Experience (The Flow)
Entry: The user opens the link to a landing page with a romantic theme.

The Question: A central GIF of a "begging puppy" appears above the question: "Will you be my Valentine?"

The Interaction: * The "Yes" Button: Large, static, and inviting.

The "No" Button: Small and evasive. It moves whenever the cursor gets close.

The Success State: Upon clicking "Yes," the screen transforms into a celebration.

3. Functional Requirements
Feature	Description
The Begging Phase	Displays a high-quality GIF of a puppy with "puppy eyes" or a similar "please" animation.
The Evasive "No"	A button that uses a JavaScript onmouseover or mouseenter event to randomly change its top and left CSS positions within the viewport.
The Acceptance	Clicking "Yes" triggers a state change: the "No" button disappears, the text changes to "I knew you'd say yes!", and the GIF switches to a celebratory version (e.g., dancing hearts or a happy puppy).
Confetti Blast	(Optional) Trigger a digital confetti explosion when "Yes" is clicked.
4. Technical Specifications
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (no heavy frameworks needed).

Logic for the "No" Button:

Use window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight to calculate the boundaries.

Update the button's style to position: absolute.

Assets: Two GIF files (one "Begging," one "Celebratory") and a soft, romantic background color or pattern.

5. Content Plan
Headline: "Hey [Name], I have a very important question..."

The Question: "Will you be my Valentine?"

Success Message: "Yay! Best Valentine's Day ever! ❤️"

6. Design & Aesthetic
Theme: Soft pinks (#FFC0CB) and deep reds (#8B0000).

Typography: Playful cursive or a clean sans-serif for readability.

Mobile Note: Since "hover" doesn't exist on touchscreens, the "No" button should jump when tapped on mobile devices to maintain the joke.

Next Step
Would you like me to write the HTML and JavaScript code for this so you can just copy, paste, and run it?

You said
yes

Perfect! Let’s get this live. I’ve written a clean, "single-file" version for you. You can save this as an .html file (e.g., valentine.html) and open it in any browser to see it in action.

I used placeholders for the GIFs, so you’ll just need to find your favorite puppy GIFs and swap the links!
